    "- 'name'.\n",
    "- 'position'.\n",
    "- 'salary'.\n",
    "\n",
    "and a method __ __str__ __() to return a string representation of the employee's information.\n",

    "Then, we are asked to create a class called Department with attributes:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Add new employees.\n",
    "- Remove employees.\n",
    "- Know the salary of all the employees combined.\n",
    "- Know the name of all employees of the department. "
